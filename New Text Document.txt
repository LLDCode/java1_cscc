Stack memory, heap memory

					Strings
Contains 0 or more characters

not a primitive type, it's a built in class

String firstname = new String("Bob");

String newname = firstname; // Makes new string the same as the string firstname

strings must use double quotes "" they can not use '' that is only for characters

					Ternary operator
String answer = (x>=0) ? "non-negative" : "negative";
^ translation if String answer >= 0 then "non-negative" else "negative";

					Output
two types of output statements
System.out.Println("Hello Columbus state!")
println makes a new line and just print doesn't

package edu.cscc;
import java.util.*; 
public class Main {
private static Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

public static void main(String[] args) { ...

					math methods
